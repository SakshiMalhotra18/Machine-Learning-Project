# 🧐 AI & Data Science Project Pipeline

📀 **A structured AI & Data Science project covering the full pipeline from Data Cleaning to Model Deployment.**  

---

## **📈 Project Overview**
This repository contains **end-to-end AI & Machine Learning projects**, covering:
- ✅ **Data Cleaning** → Preprocessing raw data
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Understanding trends & patterns
- ✅ **Feature Engineering** → Creating meaningful features for better predictions
- ✅ **Regression & Classification Models** → Training AI models for predictions
- ✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization** → Improving model performance
- ✅ **Deployment using Flask & Cloud** → Making AI models accessible online

Each stage of the AI pipeline is **structured into separate Jupyter notebooks**, making it easy to follow.
